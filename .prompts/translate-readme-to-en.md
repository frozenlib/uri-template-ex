# README Translation Prompt: Japanese to English

## Task Description

You are tasked with translating a Japanese README.ja.md file into an English README.md file. This translation should maintain the technical accuracy of the content while ensuring it reads naturally in English.

## Requirements

### Translation Quality

- Provide a professional, accurate translation that maintains all technical information
- Ensure the English text reads naturally and fluently (not like a direct translation)
- Preserve all code examples, commands, and technical terms exactly as they appear in the original
- Maintain the same structure and section organization as the original document
- Keep any links, references, and citations intact with the same targets

### Technical Considerations

- Preserve all Markdown formatting, including headers, lists, code blocks, tables, etc.
- Do not translate text within code blocks unless it's a comment that should be translated
- Maintain all GitHub-specific formatting (badges, shields, etc.)
- Preserve any version numbers, package names, and other technical identifiers exactly as they appear
- Ensure any CLI commands remain functional in the English version

### Cultural Adaptation

- Adapt culturally specific examples or phrases to make them accessible to an international audience
- Convert any date formats to international standards (YYYY-MM-DD)
- Convert any measurements to their internationally recognized units if necessary

## Process

1. First, analyze the full Japanese README.ja.md to understand its structure and content
2. Create the English README.md file with the same structure
3. Translate each section while preserving all technical accuracy and markdown formatting
4. Review the final translation to ensure it reads naturally and maintains all technical information
5. Verify that all links, code blocks, and special formatting elements work as expected

## Output Format

Provide the complete translated README.md file in proper Markdown format, ready to be used as the main English documentation for the project.
